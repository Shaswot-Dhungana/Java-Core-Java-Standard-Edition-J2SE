Encapsulation {Information Hiding} :~ Encapsulation is a mechanism
through which we can bind the data members 
and member methods in a single unit.


Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Abstraction

Note :
1. Declare class variables as Private.
2. Declare class methods/Functions  as Public.


Example :~ Class is the best example of 
            Encapsulation if variables of that class 
            are Private.
